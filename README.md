# CSUMB Programming Team Archive

A comprehensive archive of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) solutions authored by CSUMB's Programming Team across various competitive programming platforms.

## Overview

This repository serves as a centralized collection of solutions to programming problems from competitive programming platforms, maintained by the California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB) Programming Team. It provides a valuable resource for team members to learn from each other's approaches and for future team members to study proven solution strategies.

## Supported Platforms

- **LeetCode** - Algorithm and data structure problems
- **Kattis** - Competitive programming problems
- *More platforms coming soon...*
